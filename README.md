Movement
========

For the longest time, I've believed that the movement in Minecraft could use a major overhaul, especially when you
start adding PvP to the picture (let's face it, PvP in Minecraft is essentially a click and bumper car festival).
And so... I want to fix that. Or try, rather. Which will be hard, considering this will be a server-side plugin.

But anyway, here are the expected features:

- Configurable movement speed
- Air control
- Double jump
- Dodge
- Dodge jump
- Wall jump
- (Wall run?)
- Permissions for all those features
- Configurable movement regions
- Integration with arena plugins (only enable Movement when you enter BattleArena, for example)
- Translation friendly (although I expect it not to have much to translate)
- Economy, if requested

And that is about it. If you want to give me a hand, feel free to poke me at `jpmcabreu@gmail.com` or in #minecraft
